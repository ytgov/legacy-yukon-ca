              The Fortymile area lay within the traditional territory of the
              <span class="fn-characters">Hän</span>. One group of
              <span class="fn-characters">Hän</span>, the
              <span class="fn-characters">Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in</span>, hunted,
              fished, trapped and gathered throughout the region; they also had
              a seasonal fish camp at the mouth of the Klondike. They were
              experienced traders, bartering and selling goods to other First
              Nations and to the white newcomers.

              In the summer of 1896 the Yukon was still a district of the
              Northwest Territories, with its capital in Regina and its
              boundaries the source of an ongoing dispute with the United
              States. A few small trading posts were scattered along the Yukon
              River.

              A small number of miners had been at work in the Yukon since the
              late 1870s. Using basic hand-mining methods they prospected
              rivers, creeks and bars, trying to recover enough gold to sustain
              themselves for another season and hoping to make the big find that
              would make them rich.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their numbers increased after September 1886, when coarse gold was
              discovered on the Fortymile River, the first such find in the
              Yukon. By the 1890s an estimated 1000 people &mdash; almost all of
              them men &mdash; were mining in the Yukon, mostly in the Fortymile
              area.
            </p>
            <h2>
              For fourteen months we heard no news from any person or place,
              except the news of the district around us.
            </h2>
            <h3>William Ogilvie, 1887</h3>
            <p>
              A small community named Forty Mile developed at the mouth of the
              Fortymile River. It was remote from the rest of the world in a way
              that we can barely imagine, dependent for supplies on the long
              Yukon River route to St. Michael, Alaska, at the river’s mouth on
              the Bering Sea. The small sternwheelers on the river could usually
              make only one trip upstream from St. Michael each summer. Until
              the arrival of the first North-west Mounted Police contingent in
              1895, as writer Pierre Berton observed, “it was really an American
              town, getting its supplies from the United States without customs
              payments and sending out mail with U.S. stamps.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The summer of 1896 was so hot and dry that low water shortened the
              already limited navigation season. The productive ground at Forty
              Mile camp had all been staked, and the future of gold mining
              looked uncertain. Approximately 80 km upstream, however, was a
              small creek that would soon become a household word.

              Gold is valued not only for its beauty but its constancy. The
              years just before the gold rush were beset by bank failures, a
              depression and currency devaluations. Gold was seen as stable and
              dependable.
