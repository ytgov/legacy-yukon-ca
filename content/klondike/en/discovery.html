              In mid-August, 1896, an American prospector named George Carmack,
              his wife Kate Carmack (<i>Shaaw Tláa</i>), her brother Skookum Jim
              (<i>Keish</i>) and their nephew Dawson Charlie (<i>Káa Goox</i>)
              were travelling through the area south of the Klondike River.
              Resting by the side of a small stream that the miners called
              Rabbit Creek, one of them noticed a metallic glitter in the creek.
              They had found gold.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next morning, August 17, they staked their claims. Carmack
              took credit for the find, staking the discovery claim — the first
              claim on the creek — which entitled him to a second claim. They
              registered the claims at Forty Mile on September 24, within the 60
              days required by mining regulations. The closest mining recorder
              was at Forty Mile, 80 km away.

                post to Sheep Camp.

              News of their discovery raced down the Yukon River. Miners
              abandoned their claims on Fortymile and Sixtymile creeks and
              Circle City, rushing to the Klondike and staking any ground they
              could find on the stream &mdash; soon renamed Bonanza &mdash; and
              its tributaries, as well as other creeks in the district. A small
              townsite, Dawson City, started to develop at the confluence of the
              Yukon and Klondike rivers.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a year before the news reached the outside world. The gold
              that was mined that first winter couldn’t be shipped out until
              June, 1897, when the navigation season opened. The miners and
              their rich cargo travelled downriver from Dawson to St. Michael,
              at the mouth of the Yukon River, where they boarded ocean steamers
              <i>Excelsior</i> and <i>Portland</i> for the journey down the west
              coast.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>Excelsior</i> arrived in San Francisco on July 17 with a
              cargo of half a million dollars in gold, igniting public interest.
              By the time the <i>Portland</i> docked in Seattle three days
              later, a huge crowd was waiting for it on the wharf; an
              enterprising reporter named Beriah Brown of the Seattle
              Post-Intelligencer had taken a tugboat to intercept the
              <i>Portland</i> and telegraphed ahead. A newspaper headline
              trumpeting “half a ton of gold” was actually an understatement;
              the ship was carrying more than a ton of gold, worth a million
              dollars. As one contemporary writer phrased it, news of the wealth
              aboard the <i>Portland</i> “set Seattle stark mad, and the craze
              has spread over the civilized earth.”
