              By the end of July 1897, prospectors started to flood in to Dyea
              and Skagway in a steady stream. Hal Hoffman, in the
              <i>Official Guide to the Klondike Country</i>, observed: “the rush
              still keeps up and the end is not in sight... The end is in New
              York, and Chicago, and San Francisco.”

              Anyone heading into the Yukon had to have the required “ton of
              goods” &mdash; a year’s supply of food (about 1000 pounds, at
              three lbs. per day) plus another 1000 lbs. of equipment. They had
              to relay this outfit in stages, caching each load and returning
              for another.

              At Dyea, goods and passengers were off-loaded at low tide; many
              supplies were spoiled or carried away by the rising tide before
              their owners could claim them. Healy and Wilson’s pack train ran
              every day from Dyea to Sheep Camp, each horse carrying 90 kilos,
              and First Nations packers and non-native packers also worked
              steadily, but no one could keep up with the demand.

                subsequently allowed miners to use the route.

              After the backbreaking work of carrying their goods over the
              passes, stampeders faced a 1000-km trip downriver to Dawson. At
              Lindeman or Bennett they had to fell trees, whipsaw lumber and
              construct a boat that would withstand the rigours of the Yukon
              River. All of this was done at a frenzied pace, each person in a
              panic to get to the gold fields.

            <h2>
              “At least one thousand people [are] on the road from Lindeman to
              Crater, one solid stream of unsatisfied restless humanity.”

            <h3>L.B. MAY, MARCH 31, 1897</h3>
            <p>
              On the river route, stampeders had to navigate the winds of the
              headwater lakes, the rapids at Miles Canyon and the Thirtymile
              River, dubbed by the <i>Klondike Nugget</i> “a regular graveyard
              for boats,” as well as Five Finger Rapids — according to Marvin
              Sanford Marsh’s diary, a “one-minute ride I will never forget and
              I never want to take again.” Their long journey finally ended at
              Dawson, where by June 1897 the few log cabins of the previous year
              had developed into a chaotic boomtown of 4,000 people.

              When the Yukon’s first NWMP detachment came north in July 1895
              they were the territory’s only official government presence. They
              collected customs duties, tried to curb the whiskey trade and did
              what little actual policing was required. During the gold rush
              they were also inspectors of licences, postmasters and registrars
              of births and deaths. According to Superintendent Samuel Steele,
              “every individual in the police force was considered a bureau of
              information.”
