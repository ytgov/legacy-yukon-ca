              In July 1896 Dawson City didn’t yet exist; one year later it had a
              population of 5,000, the year after that, 30,000. Forty Mile, once
              the region’s principal community, was virtually abandoned. NWMP
              Inspector Charles Constantine, based at Forty Mile, had been the
              first — and, for several years, the only — person to administer
              mining regulations in the Yukon; the office was transferred to
              Dawson in 1897.

              Money itself was rare. Gold dust — worth about 16 dollars an ounce
              — was the common currency. Many other things were rare as well. It
              was almost impossible to find a cabin to live in, even if someone
              was willing to pay the high rent. Building a cabin was also an
              expensive proposition; according to Thomas Fawcett, “Common
              lumber, which in Ontario would not cost more than $6 or $7 per
              1,000 feet, is in demand at $140.”

              Some people took jobs in the town or at a mine. Claims were
              bought, sold and leased, either to make a profit or because the
              owner needed the money. A somewhat plaintive ad in the Klondike
              Nugget of July 27, 1898, reads: “Wanted to trade — Will trade a
              half-interest in a mining claim for a year’s provisions.”

              By early 1897 the
              <span class="fn-characters">Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in</span> had moved
              away from <span class="fn-characters">Tr’ochëk</span> to a
              traditional camp downriver called
              <span class="fn-characters"
                >J&#xeb;jik Ddh&#xe4;&#x300; D&#xeb;&#x300;nezhu

              (Moosehide). Although the gold rush brought new economic
              opportunities for the territory’s First Nations people, it also
              created great social and cultural upheaval.
            </p>
            <p>
              By late 1898, however, the rush was starting to subside. Even
              before the stampeders arrived in Dawson, almost all of the
              productive ground had already been staked. Thousands of hopefuls
              gave up their dream of wealth and left the territory. The
              discovery of gold in Nome, Alaska, in 1899 drew thousands more.
              The rush was over almost as quickly as it began, leaving in its
              aftermath a cosmopolitan community with electric lights,
              telephones, substantial buildings and four newspapers.

            <h4>
              Although author Jeremiah Lynch stated that “it took love and
              persuasion combined to induce women to come to the Far North,”
              women did travel to Dawson. Some accompanied their husbands;
              others came to work, some as clerks, cooks, domestic servants,
              teachers and nurses, some as dance-hall girls or prostitutes.
              Belinda Mulrooney became a hotel owner and successful
              entrepreneur. L.B. May, writing at Lindeman on March 31, 1897,
              noted: “there are several women in camp, among them our doctor.”
