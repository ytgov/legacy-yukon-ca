          <p>
            Jujiro Wada was born in 1875 in Ehime Prefecture. In 1891 he left
            Japan, stowing away in a tea chest on a freighter to San Francisco.
            He found work on the <i>Balaena</i>, a whaling ship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ship overwintered at Pauline Cove, Herschel Island, and Wada
            learned how to travel and live off the land from the Inuvialuit
            people in the area. He returned north when his contract with the
            <i>Balaena</i> was complete. Wada explored, surveyed and promoted
            new ventures throughout the Mackenzie Delta, Alaska and the Yukon,
            making journeys of hundreds of miles and more by dogsled through a
            largely untracked landscape. He led a solitary and physically
            demanding life. He was well-respected for his hardiness and good
            character, even if, as a Japanese man, he was not entirely accepted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strong anti-Asian feeling was widespread at the time. In 1901 Wada
            applied for American citizenship but his application was rejected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although legislation and attitudes discriminated against Asians,
            Wada’s physical skills and stamina were recognized and appreciated
            in the North. He returned to Japan only once, in the late 1800s,
            although he continued to send letters and money to his mother
            throughout her life. He died in San Diego in 1937.

                  a non-citizen, he was allowed to stake a claim in the Yukon,

                  recently found there, and set off a small stampede to the
