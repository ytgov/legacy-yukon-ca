            In 1921 the Yukon had 20 Asian residents; by 1941 this number had
            increased to 40. During World War II, after Japan attacked Pearl
            Harbour, Japanese nationals residing in Canada were considered enemy
            aliens and were required to register with the Department of National
            Defence. In the Yukon this work was carried out by the RCMP. In
            1942, more than 20,000 men, women and children of Japanese ancestry
            &mdash; 75 percent of whom were Canadian nationals &ndash; were
            interned in detention camps in Canada. According to archival
            sources, no Japanese in Dawson City were interned; it is not known
            if any Japanese people in other Yukon communities were interned.
          </p>
          <p>
            The years brought positive changes as well. The
            <i>Chinese Immigration Act</i>, which had virtually eliminated
            Chinese immigration to Canada, was repealed in 1947; that same year
            Chinese-Canadians and Indo-Canadians were allowed to vote. Canadians
            of Japanese descent were allowed to vote in 1948. The
            <i>Immigration Act</i> of 1967 evaluated potential citizens for
            their skills and adaptability to Canadian culture, rather than their
            ethnicity.

            Mayo, on the Stewart River, was established after gold was found on
            Duncan, Minto and Highet creeks in the early years of the 20th
            century. Rich silver-lead deposits were found on Keno Hill in 1919,
            and for nearly 20 years the area was the mainstay of the Yukon
            economy. Several Japanese families lived in the area. Although many
            of the first-generation Asian immigrants to the Yukon &mdash; and
            the rest of Canada &mdash; were single men, by the 1920s more
            families became established.
