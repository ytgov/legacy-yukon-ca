            In the early years of the territory few women came to the Klondike.
            Only a very small percentage of these women were Black.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although initially there was little work for women aside from the
            dance halls, Black women earned a living by baking or sewing,
            working as domestic servants, mining and even running their own
            businesses.

          <h2>Lucille Hunter</h2>
          <p>
            Lucille was pregnant and only 19 years old when she and her husband
            Charles left the United States in 1897 and made the trip to the
            Klondike. They travelled via the Stikine Trail, one of the most
            difficult routes to the Yukon. When they reached Teslin Lake,
            Lucille gave birth to a daughter, who they named Teslin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The family continued on to Dawson, arriving there well before most
            of the stampeders. They staked a claim on Bonanza Creek in February
            1898 and lived for a time at Grand Forks, at the confluence of
            Bonanza and Eldorado creeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Charles died in 1939 Lucille continued to operate gold claims
            in Dawson and silver claims near Mayo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every year she walked more than 200 km from Mayo to Dawson and back
            again. In 1943 she moved to Whitehorse, where she operated a
            laundry. Although she was completely blind in her later years she
            continued to be fiercely independent.
