            Black people have lived in Canada since it was first settled by
            Europeans. In 1782 British General Guy Carleton granted freedom
            certificates and passage to Canada for 3,000 slaves who had fought
            with the British in the American War of Independence. By 1835 the
            British Parliament had abolished slavery in Canada and its other
            colonies. For another 30 years most of the Black people who came to
            Canada were fleeing slavery in the United States. With the end of
            slavery in 1865 many Black Americans went back to the U.S., but some
            moved to Canada in the late 19th century to escape legal and social
            inequalities. The American South was still mostly poor and rural,
            Blacks and Whites were strictly segregated, and racial violence was
            widespread. Canada did not have an entrenched system of
            discriminatory Jim Crow laws as the U.S. then did, although racial
            segregation and discrimination was practised in many places.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1901 there were 17,437 Black people in Canada. In the Yukon, the
            frenzy of the Klondike Gold Rush had increased the population to
            nearly 30,000, including 99 Black people. The Klondike Gold Rush
            provided the promise of new opportunities, with fewer restrictions
            on the kinds of work or business ventures available to people,
            regardless of their race, ethnic background or economic or social
            status. Black people worked as household servants, barbers, waiters,
            musicians, entrepreneurs, labourers and gold miners.
