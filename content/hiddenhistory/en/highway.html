          <p>
            After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the
            United States government decided that an inland route to Alaska was
            vital. Building it would be a massive undertaking: the 2400-km route
            led through rugged and largely uncharted terrain, crossing five
            mountain ranges.
          </p>
          <p>
            The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would build the preliminary road
            through the wilderness. Since most engineer regiments had already
            been deployed, the U.S. War Department organised battalions of Black
            engineers. At that time the U.S. Army was segregated, and the new
            regiments were comprised of Black soldiers, commanded by White
            officers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Few of the new Black recruits had any training in engineering. Many
            of them came from the southern United States, and had never
            experienced a northern winter. They had to contend with a
            stereotyped view of Black men as poor soldiers who performed badly
            under stress. Most White officers were not happy to be commanding
            Black regiments, and resented their assignments. Despite all these
            handicaps, the Black soldiers managed to help push through a pioneer
            road in only eight months.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Black Canadians have served in military units since the colonization
            of Canada. In World War II, Black Canadian soldiers refused to serve
            in segregated units and were fully integrated into the army, navy
            and air force.
