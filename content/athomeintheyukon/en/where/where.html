              a variety of shelters to protect themselves from the weather.
              Different types of structures were used at different times of the
              year. There were lean-tos, circular tents with a conical pole
              frame, dome-shaped sapling frames covered with caribou or moose
              skins, moss houses and split-log houses as well as temporary
              shelters of brush and bark.

              Initially, newcomers to the territory also needed temporary
              structures that were lightweight and easy to transport. Dawson,
              Whitehorse and Bennett were all tent cities in their early days.
              As communities became more settled, and lumber and other building
              supplies became available, tents were replaced by permanent
              structures. Sometimes tents were framed in with lumber, with the
              canvas left in place; sometimes small log cabins were built, with
              lean-tos and additions built on as needed.
            </p>
            <p class="read">
              First Nations people adopted new permanent structures, although
              many continue to use seasonal homes as well. As communities grew
              and developed, newcomers tried to recreate the appearance of the
              lifestyles they left behind in the south.

              Homeowners added elaborate trim and details to their houses;
              businesspeople added false fronts to their structures to give an
              air of permanence and stability. Today a Yukon home can be
              anything from a log cabin to a condominium.
