              it is important to educate young people in a variety of ways.
              Behaviours and customs are passed on from generation to generation
              by example and by stories. Elders are held in great respect for
              their wisdom and experience, and storytelling is a valued part of
              the passing down of knowledge.

              Missionaries provided basic schooling for First Nations children
              in the early years, but as communities stabilized more formal
              schools became established. Even though Dawson was a growing city
              by 1897, one contemporary observer noted that because of high
              wages and the high cost of lumber, it would probably be another
              year before a school building was complete.

              The churches established both day schools and residential schools
              for First Nations children. Although the residential schools
              provided an education and allowed students to meet fellow students
              from other places and groups, they took children away from their
              families and their culture. Church-run residential schools
              continued to operate until the 1960s.

              The territorial government built a network of public schools from
              1900 on, and since June 1963 has offered post-secondary education.
              First Nations students are educated in their own communities now
              and all students have the opportunity to study Yukon aboriginal
              languages, culture and history close to home. Recent initiatives
              include French immersion, virtual classrooms and distance
              education.
