              shift in the late 19th century. There were probably no more than
              4,000 aboriginal people and perhaps 1,000 traders and non-native
              prospectors. The numbers exploded in a few short years to more
              than 40,000. Americans probably made up 75 percent of the gold
              rush populace; James Walsh, the territory&rsquo;s first
              Commissioner, estimated that only 25 percent of residents were
              British subjects, and only half of those were Canadians. A similar
              situation occurred in the 1940s, during the construction of the
              Alaska Highway, when residents were again outnumbered by
              Americans.

              By 1928 the territory&rsquo;s population had dropped to 3,500,
              about 40 percent of whom were First Nations people. At that time,
              Dawson was the largest community, with about 1,000 people. Keno,
              with 500 residents, had more people than Whitehorse.

              Today the Yukon has the second lowest population density (people
              per square kilometre) in the country &mdash; Prince Edward
              Island&rsquo;s is almost 50 times higher. Approximately 34,000
              people make their homes here, including about 7,000 First Nations
              people. The percentage of women in the Yukon has grown from 15
              percent in 1901 to 48 percent today.

              The French-speaking community of the Yukon includes people from
              all parts of the country and abroad. It is a community of pioneers
              who have preserved their values and language. Francophones have
              been part of the Yukon population since the days of the fur trade.

              One of the best-known pioneers was Emilie Tremblay. She came to
              the territory with her husband in 1894, and was the first
              non-native woman to climb the Chilkoot. The couple lived at Miller
              Creek in the Fortymile area, one of the Yukon&rsquo;s earliest
              mining settlements. They left for a time in the fall of 1895 but
              returned in 1898. Emilie remained in the Yukon until the early
              1940s; she died in Victoria in 1949 at the age of 77.
