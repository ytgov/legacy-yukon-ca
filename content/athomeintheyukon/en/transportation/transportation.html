              transportation underwent a major change.

              By the turn of the century steam-powered riverboats travelled the
              rivers that once saw only skin boats, rafts, poling boats and
              canoes. The construction of the White Pass railway established a
              year-round, mechanized link between the coast and the interior,
              with Whitehorse as the head of navigation. Communication also
              improved, with a telegraph line to the coast, and the advent of
              telephones.

              By 1902 a winter road linked Dawson and Whitehorse. Horse-drawn
              stages delivered passengers, freight and mail. For nearly 20 years
              the stage line was a vital link, but by the late 1930s airplanes
              had replaced the stages. The construction of the Alaska Highway,
              along First Nations trails and early roads, created a corridor
              across the territory linking it to the rest of the continent. In
              the 1950s a highway was completed from Whitehorse to Dawson,
              ending the era of the sternwheelers.

              New methods of transportation brought other changes too.
              Limitations created by the Yukon&rsquo;s isolation and vast
              distances gradually diminished as transportation and communication
              improved. Modern inventions, such as faxes, e-mail and satellites,
              bring the rest of the world ever closer.
