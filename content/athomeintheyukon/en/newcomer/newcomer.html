              <span class="first">The first newcomers, the fur traders,</span>
              came to the territory in the middle of the 19th century. Their
              explorations led to increased interest by the outside world, soon
              whalers, prospectors, traders and scientists had also started to
              arrive.
            </p>
            <p class="read">
              This was a new era: a time of exchanges. The newcomers and the
              Yukon&rsquo;s first peoples had many opportunities to learn from
              each other. Prospectors and traders followed aboriginal travel
              routes, hired native packers and adapted local clothing and tools.
              First Nations people gained access to new technologies &mdash;
              weapons, materials, utensils, clothing and foods &mdash; that had
              a profound effect on their lives. Change also brought new
              problems: disease, conflict, poverty, crime and family breakdown.
            </p>
            <p class="read">
              The presence of the newcomers, many of them Americans, made the
              Canadian government realize that it had to assert control over
              this remote area. The federal government had not established
              treaties with the resident Indian population, as in other parts of
              the country. The North-West Mounted Police were sent here in 1894
              as the first &lsquo;official&rsquo; notice that the Yukon was, in
              fact, part of Canada.
            </p>
            <p class="read">
              With the discovery of gold in the Klondike, these gradual
              adaptations accelerated almost overnight. Thousands of
              gold-seekers flooded into the Yukon, stretching resources and
              straining existing relationships. New businesses and services plus
              the increased speed and power of new technologies radically
              altered the Yukon. The territory&rsquo;s population continued to
              change and diversify through the years to the Second World War and
              into the present day.
