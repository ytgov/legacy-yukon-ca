              <span class="first">In the late 19th century the Yukon</span> had
              a very small population most of whom were aboriginal.
              Anthropologist Catharine McClellan has estimated that there was
              possibly an average of less than a single person in a hundred
              square kilometres. Small groups of miners and trappers also lived
              here, working along some of the territory&rsquo;s creeks and
              rivers.
            </p>
            <p class="read">
              There was little government presence; the territory was then still
              a provisional district of the Northwest Territory, and was
              governed from Regina. But in October 1897 the Yukon was
              &ldquo;elevated to the dignity of a District&rdquo;; the following
              year, on June 13, 1898, the Yukon Territory officially came into
              being.
            </p>
            <p class="read">
              At that time the territory was governed by Commissioner and
              Council who were appointed by Ottawa. It was another five years
              before the first Federal Minister visited the Yukon and ten years
              before the Yukon had an elected, and not an appointed, council. In
              the 1970s the territorial government adopted its present form. The
              territory&rsquo;s status is similar to that of a province,
              although unlike provincial powers, territorial powers are derived
              from the Parliament of Canada and may be changed by Parliament.
              Most Yukon communities have a municipal government today.
            </p>
            <p class="read">
              In 1973 Yukon First Nations people began to negotiate land claims
              agreements with the federal and territorial governments,
              formalizing their arrangements over self-government, land-use,
              wildlife, education, justice and heritage. Today land claims
              legislation is enshrined in the Canadian constitution. These new
              partnerships give all Yukon people the opportunity to share in the
              responsibilities of government.

              Major James Morrow Walsh (c), seen here at Bennett, was appointed
              the first Commissioner of the Yukon in August 1897. His trip north
              was fraught with problems; he didn&rsquo;t arrive in Dawson until
              May 1898, by which time he had decided to resign.
