              brought great change to settlements and communities. The Han
              people saw the site of their fish camp at the mouth of the
              Klondike River transformed into Dawson City. Whitehorse developed
              from a seasonal fish camp into a busy transfer point at the head
              of rail.

              The sternwheelers travelled the waterways for more than 50 years
              linking the small settlements along the rivers and lakes. Many
              trading posts, communities and wood camps grew up along the
              sternwheeler routes and the winter roads.

              The Yukon, once home only to small scattered groups of people, now
              also had larger, more settled, permanent communities with schools,
              roads and services. Until the 1940s, many First Nations people
              continued to live on the land away from settled areas.

              As gold mining declined, Dawson shrank to a fraction of its former
              size; in 1923, the Mayo area, with its silver-lead production,
              overtook the Klondike as the main mineral region in the territory.
              Some settlements, at the mercy of mining fortunes, boomed for a
              short time and then declined into ghost towns.

              Transportation continued to change and develop. With the end of
              the riverboat traffic, communities shifted again, away from the
              rivers that had once been the territory&rsquo;s lifeblood to the
              new all-weather highways.

              In the early days, a roadhouse was a home away from home for
              people travelling on the Yukon&rsquo;s roads. The roadhouses
              offered food and accommodation, plus shelter for horses, and were
              welcome stops in the cold winter months.
