              exists between human beings and the animals on which they depend
              for survival. They have important oral traditions about their
              world and those who live in it. They feel that powerful spirits
              have an influence on the natural world and on them.

              Traditional beliefs began to be influenced by Christian theology
              in the middle of the 19th century, although First Nations people
              have maintained many of their spiritual observances. Potlatches
              are particularly important events; they are given to mark a death,
              and as memorial ceremonies held one or two years after
              someone&rsquo;s death. They can also honour other important
              milestones, such as naming a child, or to celebrate a first hunt.
              Potlatches are given by one clan on behalf of the opposite clan.
              They are times of feasting, singing, dancing and gift-giving.

              Over the years, the Yukon has been home to people with a wide
              variety of religious faiths. Church representatives first came
              north as missionaries to work with the First Nations people.
              Anglican Archdeacon Robert McDonald was one of the first to
              establish a mission, settling at Fort Yukon in 1862. The Catholic
              Church was also active in the north. As early as the gold rush,
              people with many different faiths began to make their homes in the
              territory. This rich diversity of spirituality continues today.
