          Yukoners of all ages make the most of the winter months by
          participating in sports, volunteering at events and attending
          competitions. As the Yukon has grown, communities have built hockey
          arenas, curling rinks and recreation centres. The territory now has
          two downhill ski areas and a world-class cross-country facility.

        <h2>Territorial Experimental Ski Training</h2>
        <p>
          Father Mouchet, an Oblate priest from eastern France, founded the
          Territorial Experimental Ski Training, or TEST, program in 1967. Two
          skiers from Old Crow who had participated in the program qualified for
          the Canadian National Cross Country Ski Team.

        <h2>Arctic Winter Games</h2>
        <p>
          It was at the first Canada Winter Games, held in Quebec in 1967, that
          the idea of organising a northern games competition was generated.
          Several northern leaders were struck by the advantages that would be
          gained if northern athletes had the opportunity to compete against
          other northern teams. Three years later, the first Arctic Winter Games
          were held in Yellowknife.
